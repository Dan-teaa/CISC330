    200 -> (Success/OK) The action/ page requested was completed successfully
    400 -> (Bad Request) When a client requests a page and the server isn’t able to understand
    401 -> (Unauthorized Error) The HTTP status code requires user authentication. 
    403 -> (Forbidden) The server understands the request, but still refuses to fulfill it. 
    404 -> (Not Found) When a URL is requested but not found
    500 -> (Internal Server Error) The server runs into an issue. 

4. Data validation is important for several reasons:
    Accuracy -> Ensuring user data is entered correctly, and alternatively stored/ managed correctly 
    Safety -> Allows us to protect from malicious script inputs/ other schemes. 

5.  Cookies -> Tell the browser to store data about the user in a text file called a cookie. Each time the browser requests another page from that domain, the browser sends the data in the cookie back to the server. Servers can access cookies using the $_COOKIE superglobal
    Session -> Store information about a user and their preferences on the server. They only store the data for the duration of a single visit to the site, but can be used across pages.
